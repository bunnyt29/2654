Hello, everybody!        
This is my 7 hours challenge in which I tried to make the design provided by Frontend Mentor into real website.
You can view the challenge from Frontend Mentor on the following link: https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/bookmark-landing-page-5d0b588a9edda32581d29158/hub
For everybody who wants to test it - you should firstly enable Watch Sass before opening the project.
